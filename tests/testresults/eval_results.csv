How does HER2 amplification affect survival rates?," HER2 amplification affects survival rates in node-positive patients. The actuarial curve for relapse shows that node-positive patients with any amplification of HER2/neu have a higher risk of relapse compared to those without amplification (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the actuarial curve for overall survival indicates that node-positive patients with any amplification of HER2/neu also have a lower overall survival rate compared to those without amplification (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, among node-positive patients with amplification, those with greater than 5 copies of HER2/neu have an even higher risk of relapse and lower overall survival rate compared to those with less than or equal to 5 copies (Fig. 3C and D).","Picornavirions have relative molecular mass of about 8.5 x 10° daltons, of which about 30 percent is RNA.

What is HER2 and how is it related to breast cancer?," HER2, also known as c-erbB-2, is a human erbB-related gene that was independently isolated by two other groups. It is related to breast cancer in that its amplification has been found to be associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy in patients (Table 4).","Recently, a novel transforming gene was identified as a result of transfection studies with DNA from chemically induced rat neu- roglioblastomas (20). This gene, called new, was shown to be related to, but distinct from, the c-erbB proto-oncogene (21). By means of v-erbB and human EGFR as probes to screen human genomic and complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries, two other groups indepen- dently isolated human erbB-related genes that they called HER-2 (22) and c-erbB-2 (23). Subsequent sequence analysis and chromo- somal mapping studies revealed all three genes (neu, c-erbB-2, and HER-2) to be the same (22, 24, 25). A fourth group, also using v- erbB as a probe, identified the same gene in a carcinoma cell line, MAC 117, where it was found to be amplified five- to ten- fold (26).;;patients, even when other prognostic factors were taken into account (Table 4).

Amplification was found in 34/86 (40%) of these patients. For this larger sample of node-positive patients, several statistically significant or nearly significant relationships were observed. In agreement with the preliminary survey, there was an association between number of involved lymph nodes and HER-2/ neu amplification (Table 2). In addition, the presence of gene amplification was correlated with estrogen receptor status and size of primary tumor (Table 2).

"Which drugs are recommended for HER2-positive breast cancer patients, and at what dosage?"," For HER2-positive breast cancer patients, the recommended drugs are trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

Although the organization of the major capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 of Mengo virus is essentially the same as in rhino- and polioviruses, large insertions and deletions, mostly in VP1, radically alter the surface features. In particular, the putative receptor binding “canyon” of human rhinovirus 14 becomes a deep “pit” in Mengo virus because of polypeptide insertions in VP1 that fill part of the canyon. The minor capsid peptide, VP4, is completely internal in M virus, but its association with the other capsid proteins is substantially different from that in rhino- or poliovirus. However, its carboxyl terminus is located at a position similar to that in human rhinovirus 14 and poliovirus, ing the same autocatalytic cleavage of VPO to VP4 and VP2 takes place during assembly in all",47.55,1,1

"Were any adverse events reported during the HER2 study, and how were they managed?", No adverse events were reported during the HER2 study.,"RNA and/or protein level will prove important in determining if HER-2/neu amplification results in an expected increased gene expression. The question of amplification of HER-2/neu in metastatic as compared to primary lesions in a given patient is important. The current study utilized only primary breast tumors for analyses. It would be of interest to determine if HER-2/nex copy number is altered as the tumor metastasizes. A recent study evaluating N-myc copy number in human small cell carcinoma of the lung showed no difference between primary and metastatic lesions (11).;;The initial survey from the current study showed that 15% of breast cancer patients with stage I disease (node-negative) have HER-2/nex amplification. Unfortunately, no long-term follow-up data were available for these patients. This stage I setting may be an additional group in which HER-2/nex measurements will have an impact in predicting biologic behavior of the tumor, and as a result, in design of treatment strategy. Finally, if the HER-2/nex gene product functions as a growth factor receptor that plays a role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, identification of its ligand and development of specific antagonists could have important therapeu- tic implications.
