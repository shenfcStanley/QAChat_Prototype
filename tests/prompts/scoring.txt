Given the following question, answer, and reference paragraph from a research paper, rate the answer on a scale from 1 to 5 for clinical correctness and completeness.
Only give a score of 5 if the answer is factually accurate and clearly indicates when information is not present in the reference. Do not award 5 if the answer includes speculation, invented details, or implies information not supported by the reference.
Return ONLY the number (1–5). No explanation.
[QUESTION]: What statistical methods were used to e
valuate HER2’s effect on outcomes?

[ANSWER]   The statistical methods used to evaluate HER2's effect on outcomes were not mentioned in the provided context.

[REFERENCE]: Picornavirions have relative molecular mass of about 8.5 x 10Â° daltons, of which about 30 percent is RNA. The virus icles are spherical with an external diameter of about 300 A. The coat proteins form a shell with icosahedral symmetry with 60 protomers, each composed of a single copy of VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4 (Fig. 1) with approximate relative molecular masses of 34,000, 30,000, 25,000, and 7,000 daltons, respectively. For Mengo virus, the proteins consist of 277, 256, 231, and 70 amino acids, respectively. On degrading Mengo virus, the virions separate into 13.48 pen- tamers and then into 6S protomers (3, 4) consistent with structural observations (5). Traditionally, the cardiovirus capsid proteins have been designated a, B, y, and 8 in order of decreasing size; the VP1 (a), VP2 (B), VP3 (y), VP4 (8) nomenclature is used in this article in order to facilitate comparison with other picornaviruses. The viral;;patients, even when other prognostic factors were taken into account (Table 4). Rearrangement of the HER-2/neu gene was rare. Of the total 189 tumors evaluated, three showed evidence of rearrangement, and in two of the three cases, the rearrangement was identical (Fig. 1, cases 77 to 79). Also, two of...
