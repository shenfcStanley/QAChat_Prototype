## Assumptions

The following assumptions were made in this take-home use case study:
1. **Query Topics Selection:** In order to cover a diverse set of queries (diverse user base) to evaluate the chatbot's performance, I defined query topics as __Basic Questions__, __Clinical Questions__, __Scientific Questions__, and __Ambiguous or Others__ questions.
2. **Domain Expertise Assumed:** In this prototype, I viewed myself as the domain expert to manually evaluate chatbot responses for all categories (for accuracy scoring). In the real-world scenario, it would be better invite domain experts from different background for human-level annotation.
