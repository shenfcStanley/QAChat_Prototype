# QAChat_Prototype

## Description
This is the take-home case study/real world problem exercise finished by **Feichen Shen**.  
In this task, a Q/A chatbot prototype was built to address diverse questions related to a specific research paper. The work also clearly presented comprehensive evaluations/testing/KPI definition and detailed how clinical network embeddings can be incorporated.

## Overall Workflow

The overall workflow is designed based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture:
1. Query Submission
2. Knowledge (e.g., research paper) Ingestion and Indexing
3. Semantic search
4. Contextual Prompt Design
5. Post-processing and Response Generation
