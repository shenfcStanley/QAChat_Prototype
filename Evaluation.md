### ðŸ§ª Evaluation Overview

This evaluation assesses the chatbotâ€™s ability to generate clinically accurate, grounded answers from a HER2 breast cancer paper, using Clinical-Knowledge-Embeddings as the default selected strategy and Mistral-7B as the open source LLM.

**Assumption:** Based on initial testing, Clinical-Knowledge-Embeddings provided the most clinically relevant retrieval results. Thus, evaluation was scoped to this embedding configuration for all 16 queries.

#### Query Augmentation
`Zephyr-7B-Beta` was utilized as a third-party language model for query/data augmentation.

#### LLM-based Scoring and Human-level Scoring
`ChatGPT-4o` was used for automated result scoring. Prompts for query augmentation and auto scoring is under `tests\prompts`. I serve as the domain expert to conduct human-level scoring.


#### Business Metrics
